## **About**

A minimalist iOS tuner app written in Swift. Inspired by Jack Schaedler's magnificent article [The Audio Processing Dog House](https://www.objc.io/issues/24-audio/audio-dog-house/) in issue 24 of [objc.io](/www.objc.io). The pitch recognition alogorithm was taken from the publication [A Smarter Way to Find Pitch](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230554927_A_smarter_way_to_find_pitch) by Philip McLeod and Geoff Wyvill.

## **To Do**

Implement parabolic interpolation to increase the accuracy of pitch recognition.
